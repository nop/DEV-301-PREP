				<h1>About me</h1>
				<h3>Programming experience</h3>
				<p>
					I have been programming and using Linux for 6 years, writing both GUI and CLI userspace programs.
					I've taken an interest in compilers and operating systems as well.
					I love working on customizing and optimizing my Arch Linux system, and have a strong foundation for systems administration.
					My passion for learning has driven me to diversify my programming language repertoire, including Java, Rust, Go, C, Python, and a little Haskell.
					My previous work involved using a niche DSL, which has inspired me to create a compiler and tooling to support the language.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm learning web development because it's a popular and useful domain, and I would like to build websites for my projects.
					I would love to collaborate others on projects, so please <a href='#contact'>reach out to me</a> if you're interested!
